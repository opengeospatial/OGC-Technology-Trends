|Description |Data published on the web are made discoverable, accessible and interoperable using WWW best practices for data formats, data access, data identifiers, metadata, licensing and provenance. Individual data instances are each given an URI identifier and published at that URI; using links, these instances are integrated with other data, thus creating the Web of Data. The Web thus becomes the exchange medium for data as well as documents - you might think of it as 'one big database'.
| What is new or emerging?	|Enormous volumes of data are available on the Web today but it is typically published through portals that act on behalf of multiple agencies, not on the Web sites operated by those agencies themselves. These portals are effectively data silos and inaccessible to search engine crawlers, making it hard to discover the data inside portals. Also, data is typically made accessible on the dataset level: datasets can be discovered, downloaded, viewed etc. With the Web of Data, it becomes possible to discover, and link to, individual instances inside datasets from all over the world, without having to peruse metadata catalogs, download the data, query a service, etc.

It, of cource, has all usual sophisticated features you need: login/logout, pull to refresh, infinite scroll, new tweet, delete your own tweet (but not other's tweets!), filter tweets and open tweet details. In a best case scenario for well structured code you will end up with ~200-500 lines of code for this view controller.

Look ma no official funding
---------------------------

Pillow 2.0.0 was an enormous effort, made possible by a generous grant from the Python Software Foundation. But things have stablized quite a bit since then. So much so, that with help from many others I was able to squeeze this release into my normal schedule. However you are always welcome to financially help support Pillow, especially if you are using it in a commercial environment.

<h2>Tufts University Department of Computer Science, Fall 2017</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Mobile has an enormous impact on our lives and it is linking virtually the entire human population.  Students will work in pairs to design, implement, test, publish, and support mobile applications including web-based APIs.  The Android mobile platform will be predominately used.  Topics include constraints in mobile development, app lifecycle, permissions model, widgets, layouts, event handling, networking, geolocation, threat landscape.  There will also be an exercise to reverse engineer mobile apps.  Lower-level topics including the Android kernel and the radio layer may also be discussed.</p>
