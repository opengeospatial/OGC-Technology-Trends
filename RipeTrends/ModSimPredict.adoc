|Title | Modeling, Simulation and Prediction
|Description | Simulation modelling is the process of creating and analyzing a digital prototype of a physical model to predict its performance in the real world. Models and simulation can be used for analysis and for training.
| What is new or emerging?	| Increases in development of Graphical Processing Units (GPU)s on computers and mobile devices is enabling, more on the fly modelling, simulation and prediction.
| Why might it matter? | In scenarios such as Humanitarian disaster response, being able to process on the fly models, simulations, ensures more timely responses.
