|Title | Ambient services
|Description | Ambient intelligence (AmI) refers to electronic environments that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of people.  In an ambient intelligence world, devices work in concert to support people in carrying out their everyday life activities, tasks and rituals in an easy, natural way using information and intelligence that is hidden in the network connecting these devices (see Internet of Things). As these devices grow smaller, more connected and more integrated into our environment, the technology disappears into our surroundings until only the user interface remains perceivable by users. (Wikipedia)
| What is new or emerging?	| Intelligent always on ambient service devices, able to respond with a geospatial query at the ask of a question "[Ambient Service]  Will it rain today?"
| Why might it matter? | Could possibly be the Gadget of this "holiday season", with Apple HomePod and Microsoft device.  Mapbox has demoed integration into Amazon Alexi using Mapbox Travel APIs.
