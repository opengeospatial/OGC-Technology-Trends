|Title | Statistics and Geography
|Description | As well as geospatial information, Governments and government bodies are increasingly reliant on statistical data to inform policy and decision making. As resources become constrained, it is increasingly important to make sure they are used in the most effective way  possible. Geography is often the medium through which statistics are interpreted whether at global, regional, national or sub‐national level. As the need for better statistics increases so does the need for greater integration of statistics and geospatial information, resulting in so called spatial statistics - (GGIM).
