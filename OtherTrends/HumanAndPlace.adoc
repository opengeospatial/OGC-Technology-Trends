|Title | Human and Place
|Description | Topic is focused on Human and Place (Geography). This refers to the use of place, and how vernacular geography is used to describe it. One must avoid the temptation to think of place only as a location. (DSTL)  A place is distinguished by its people, markets, governments, and institutions, as much as it is by its physical landscape and natural resources, transportation systems (including streets and roads), buildings, and boundaries- (US National Academies).
