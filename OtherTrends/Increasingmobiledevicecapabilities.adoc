|Title | Increasing mobile device capabilities
|Description | With the coming of driverless cars; drones; wearables and implantables; and an ecology of embedded devices and services in the everyday environment, there has never been a more exciting and pressing time to debate and explore what digital mobility means.  MobileHCI brings together people from diverse areas which provides a multidisciplinary forum for academics, hardware and software developers, designers and practitioners to discuss the challenges and potential solutions for effective interaction with and through mobile devices, applications, and services (MobileHCI).
